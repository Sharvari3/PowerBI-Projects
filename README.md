# Unicorn Companies Dashboard
Over the last few weeks, I've been diving into the world of Power BI, a powerful tool for data analytics and visualization. As a newbie in this realm, each step has been a thrilling learning experience. 🔍🎉

I'm excited to share that as part of this learning journey, I took on the Maven Analytics Challenge 🏆📈 . It's been an incredible opportunity to work with real-world data, analyze it, and create meaningful visualizations. I had the opportunity to analyze data on unicorn companies, delving into crucial aspects like their present valuations, funding, country of origin, industries, and key investors.
