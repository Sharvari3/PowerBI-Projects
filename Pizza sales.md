# Findings:

Friday, Thursday, and Saturday emerge as the peak days with high pizza orders, particularly around 13:00, while Sunday appears to be the slowest day for the lowest pizza sales. 📈

The busiest times are at 1:00 PM and 6:00 PM, with pizza sales reaching 3,222 and 2,577, respectively. 🕐

People really love the Thai Chicken pizza, but The Brie Carre pizza isn't as popular with customers." 🍕😄🙁

The average order is worth around $38.30, resulting in a total revenue of $817.86K. 💰📊

Customers prefer large-sized pizzas, and July marks the peak in pizza sales for the entire year. 🍕📈🔝

The Classic and Supreme pizza categories are the top sellers. 🍕
