# Apple's greenhouse gas emissions
I've just completed a detailed analysis using Apple's greenhouse gas emissions data from 2015 to 2022, a data set from Maven Analytics. This analysis is part of Apple's journey toward achieving net-zero emissions by 2030. It covers every aspect of emissions, from corporate operations to product life cycles. Plus, it dives into the carbon footprint of their baseline iPhone during this time. 🌱📊♻️

# Findings:

Apple's iPhones don't have the same environmental impact. We found that the total carbon footprint of ten different models ranges from 54 to 79 kilograms of CO2 equivalent (kg CO2e), a 46.30% difference. This stark contrast underscores significant environmental variations between these models. It's clear that each iPhone model has a unique impact on our planet. 🍃 📱

Apple wants to be eco-friendly, but it's hard. When devices have more storage, they cause more pollution. This means Apple needs to figure out how to make cool gadgets without harming the Earth.🔍 

Apple has actively cut emissions, as shown in the chart. From 2015 to 2022, emissions dropped by 47%. Predictions suggest Apple could slash emissions by a whopping 96.89% by 2030, surpassing their goal of a 75% reduction from 2015 levels🌍

Apple is making headway in reducing pollution, especially in Scope 1 and 2. They need to work more on Scope 3 emissions from their supplies. If they keep improving in these areas, they might achieve their goal of no pollution by 2030.💚🌍
